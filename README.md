# node-etutils
A collection of miscellaneous utilities for node

This package collects a number of smaller routines that we have found useful over
the years, including a logger that we prefer for most of our projects. In general
these smaller things have not risen to the level of needing their own package
although we may split several of them off over time.

All code is provided under an MIT license. We're not liable for your
use of this software and you need to keep the license intact without passing
this off as your own original creation.
